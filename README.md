Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Fillo. I'm a computer engineering student and work as a software engineer in Italy, where I'm from. 
I'm interested in reading books, going to the gym, and learning new things. Currently, 
I'm focusing on React, Blazor, and C#. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve learned and practiced many other technologies and programming languages.
